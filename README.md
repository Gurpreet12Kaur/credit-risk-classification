# credit-risk-classification

For this challenge, I had the following task to do:

**Data Split into Training and Testing Sets:**

I opened the starter code notebook and followed these steps:
- Loaded data from "lending_data.csv" in the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Created labels (y) from the "loan_status" column and features (X) DataFrame from other columns.
- Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

**Creating a Logistic Regression Model with Original Data:**

I utilized my knowledge of logistic regression as follows:
- Fit a logistic regression model using the training data (X_train and y_train).
- Predicted testing data labels with the model using X_test.
- Evaluated model performance by:
  - Generating a confusion matrix.
  - Printing the classification report.
- Answered a key question about the model's predictive capabilities.

**Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report:**

I composed a concise report, the README.md in my GitHub repository, adhering to the provided template. My report encompassed:
- An analysis overview explaining the analysis's purpose.
- Results presented through a bulleted list, covering accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.
- A summary that briefly encapsulated model results and offered a justification for recommending or not recommending the model's use by the company.

Overall, this challenge was not too bad; I had very few problems compared to the other challenge.
